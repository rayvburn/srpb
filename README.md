# srpb

The repository contains the source code of the SRPB - **S**ocial **R**obot **P**lanners **B**enchmark - a benchmark that allows for quantitative evaluation of robot navigation performance and social aspects.

![Graphical abstract](doc/graphical_abstract.png)

The corresponding package that allows logging data while the robot is navigating (using ROS1 navigation stack) is available at [`srpb_move_base`](https://github.com/rayvburn/srpb_move_base).

A detailed description of metrics computation formulas is presented in the article [`Quantitative metrics for benchmarking human-aware robot navigation`](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10194930).

If you are using this benchmark in your research, please cite it as:

## Installation

Follow the steps below to clone SRPB-related packages:

```sh
cd <WS_DIR>/src
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:rayvburn/srpb.git -b melodic-devel srpb/srpb
rosinstall -n . srpb/srpb/srpb.rosinstall
```

## Usage

A log file is saved once the goal is reached by the `srpb_move_base` node. Renewing the goal pose before reaching the previous one does not cause the files to be divided into parts.

## Acknowledgments

The foundation of this package is [`MRPB`: Mobile Robot Local Planning Benchmark](https://github.com/NKU-MobFly-Robotics/local-planning-benchmark). There might be some shared sections of code, but overall, the original package has undergone a major overhaul.
